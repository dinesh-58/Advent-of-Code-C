[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2015/events) is a yearly christmas-themed coding challenge that can be done in any language. I'm doing these in C to implement what I've learned in class & learn some more.

### My file naming system:


Every day has 2 challenges. Here, "1 p1.c" refers to the 1st challenge for day 1.

The inputs for these challenges are unique for each user & the site will only show the 2nd challenge if your 1st program's output is correct. These inputs can get quite large so you'll want to store them in files rather than pasting into the terminal.

If you're reading this, you should definitely consider doing these challenges too. Looking at others' implementations after successfully finishing  yours can also help you learn. All the best.
